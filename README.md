### Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a virtual autopilot for a sailing boat as well as a simulation environment.

At the current stage I have no idea how to do this so I'm just playing around.

### Demo

Here's a [live demo](http://langalex.github.io/autopilot).

### Usage

Runs completely in the browser. To run:

    npm install -g ember-cli
    ember server

To build:

    ember build

### Future Ideas

* wind: changing direction, gusts
* steer to wind angle
* waves pushing the boat around
* boat speed, influence of rudders, wind angle
* angular momentum of the boat
* preventing gybes/tacks
* tacking, gybing
* repeatable tests for autopilot behavior
* sailing to waypoints
